# Color-Recognition-using-machine-learning
Color detection is the process of finding the color in a picture. This seems a simple task if we talk about the human eye but for the computer it is a more complex process needing the right tools and programming techniques.
In this color detection python project we have built a platform through which we can automatically get the color name by choosing any of the given choices, which are as as follows:
1- Detect Uploaded Image Color.
2- Detect Color of selected point on Image.
3- Detect Color using Webcam capture.
4- Detect Color using Webcam.
We have used two datasets for this project. The first dataset is the image dataset which we have created manually. It contains the basic VIBGYOR colors.
The second dataset is a predefined dataset which we have downloaded from the internet through github. It contains a wide variety of colors from basic to complex.
The user will get a choice to choose between any of the datasets depending upon the extent of accuracy needed to detect the color.
